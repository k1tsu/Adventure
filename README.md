### Running a clone
Honestly, you should just invite the existing bot.
[You can do that with this link.](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=482373088109920266&permissions=388160&scope=bot)

But if you really want to set it up for yourself, here are the instructions:

1. You'll need Python 3.6.x - 3.7.x. I haven't tested any other versions.
2. You'll also need Redis 5.0.4, PostgreSQL 10/11, and Git.
3. Set up all of the above, however you do on your platform.
4. Clone this repo into where ever you need it, and rename the `config_example.py`
file to `config.py`.
5. Fill in the config with your credentials.
6. Create a directory named `logs`. I always forget to do this part.
7. (optional) Prepare a Virtual Environment in the `venv` directory.
8. Run the launcher. It will install all the pip dependencies.

\* disclaimer: you do not kill your friends.

\*\* This is the goal. Currently there are not this many enemies.
